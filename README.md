#This is the BETA Android client for [ownCloud][0]

The BETA app is only intended to be used by experienced users that want to use and test the latest features.
All pull requests labeled "3 - to review" or higher will be included into the branch.

If you find a bug please verify first if it is *really* a bug in beta, then comment in the corresponding pull request or create a new issue with the prefix "Beta YYYY-MM-DD:".

The compiled APKs can be found [here][2]

The changelog is found [here][3]

The app performs file synchronization with an ownCloud server. Other ownCloud features may be added in the future, but they are not a priority right now.
